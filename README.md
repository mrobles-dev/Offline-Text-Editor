## Description

Progressive web apps, or PWAs, are what modern applications aspire toward at production. Learning the ways that make an app accessible on mobile devices, as well as offline, or cached, are essential for PWAs. 

- This project taught me about webpack and how to utilize it in my code
- With the webpack, I also utilized babel loader which gave me a lot of debugging to do.
- PWAs aim to allow apps to be used even while offline, think downloading Netlfix movies for a flight but like a lower scale clone
- My biggest takeaway from this was yet another database, the IndexedDB. It isn't meant to hold large amounts of data but can do just fine with simple applications such as this one.
